## 🚀 Getting Started

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code. It allows you to collaborate with others, manage different versions of your project, and revert to previous states if needed.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a place to host your Git repositories, collaborate with others, and manage projects. GitHub also offers features like issues, pull requests, and GitHub Actions for automation.

### How to Download and Install Git

1. **Download Git**:
   - Visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - Choose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     git --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Git version.

### How to Get Started with GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub Account**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Set Up SSH Keys** (Optional but recommended):
   - Follow the [GitHub guide on SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to secure your connection.

3. **Create Your First Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner of GitHub and select "New repository."
   - Follow the prompts to create a new repository.
